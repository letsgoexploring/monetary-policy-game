This repository contains software and instructions for running the experiments in the article *A Classroom Experiment in Monetary Policy* by [John Duffy](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~duffy/) and [Brian C Jenkins](http://www.briancjenkins.com/). Below you will find a software and instructions for running the experiment.



## Instructions for running monetary policy game.

1. Install the  z-Tree program, ztree.exe on a web server. Install zleaf.exe on client workstations. Connect to the  z-Tree webserver using zleaf.exe client.
2. Run  z-Tree.exe and check that enough clients are connected. Then open and run the monetary policy game, the .ztt file.
3. The program is currently set up for 10 clients, 2 groups of 5. These choices can be easily modified by doubleclicking on the background tab in  z-Tree and changing the number of players and groups.
4. The policy regime can be changed under the background tab as well, by changing the value for lambda in the "Setting Global Parameters" table of the program.

# A Classroom Experiment in Monetary Policy


This repository contains software and instructions for running the experiments in the article *A Classroom Experiment in Monetary Policy* by [John Duffy](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~duffy/) and [Brian C Jenkins](http://www.briancjenkins.com/).



## Instructions for running monetary policy game

1. Install the  z-Tree program, `ztree.exe` on a web server. Install `zleaf.exe` on client workstations. Both executables are available in the `zTree` directory in this repository. Connect to the z-Tree webserver using zleaf.exe client.
2. Run `ztree.exe` and check that enough clients are connected. Then open and run the monetary policy game, the `.ztt` file.
3. The program is currently set up for 10 clients, 2 groups of 5. These choices can be easily modified by doubleclicking on the background tab in  z-Tree and changing the number of players and groups.
4. The policy regime can be changed under the background tab as well, by changing the value for lambda in the "Setting Global Parameters" table of the program.

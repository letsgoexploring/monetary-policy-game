Instructions for running monetary policy game.
1. Install the zTree program, ztree.exe on a web server. Install zleaf.exe on client workstations. Connect to the zTree webserver using zleaf.exe client.
2. Run zTree.exe and check that enough clients are connected. Then open and run the monetary policy game, the .ztt file.
3. The program is currently set up for 10 clients, 2 groups of 5. These choices can be easily modified by doubleclicking on the background tab in zTree and changing the number of players and groups.
4. The policy regime can be changed under the background tab as well, by changing the value for lambda in the "Setting Global Parameters" table of the program.
